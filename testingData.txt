old kingdom of egypt
the old kingdom is the period in the third millennium ( c. 2686-2181 bc ) also known as the ` age of the pyramids ' or ` age of the pyramid builders ' as it includes the great 4th dynasty when king sneferu perfected the art of pyramid building and the pyramids of giza were constructed under the kings khufu , khafre , and menkaure .
egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization -- the first of three so-called `` kingdom '' periods ( followed by the middle kingdom and new kingdom ) which mark the high points of civilization in the lower nile valley .
the term itself was coined by eighteenth-century historians and the distinction between the old kingdom and the early dynastic period is not one which would have been recognized by ancient egyptians .
not only was the last king of the early dynastic period related to the first two kings of the old kingdom , but the ` capital ' , the royal residence , remained at ineb-hedg , the ancient egyptian name for memphis .
the basic justification for a separation between the two periods is the revolutionary change in architecture accompanied by the effects on egyptian society and economy of large-scale building projects .
the old kingdom is most commonly regarded as the period from the third dynasty through to the sixth dynasty ( 2686 -- 2181 bc ) .
the 4th-6th dynasties of egypt , are scarce and historians regard the history of the era as literally ` written in stone ' and largely architectural in that it is through the monuments and their inscriptions that scholars have been able to construct a history .
egyptologists also include the memphite seventh and eighth dynasties in the old kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at memphis .
while the old kingdom was a period of internal security and prosperity , it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by egyptologists as the first intermediate period .
during the old kingdom , the king of egypt ( not called the pharaoh until the new kingdom ) became a living god who ruled absolutely and could demand the services and wealth of his subjects .
under king djoser , the first king of the third dynasty of the old kingdom , the royal capital of egypt was moved to memphis , where djoser established his court .
a new era of building was initiated at saqqara under his reign .
king djoser 's architect , imhotep is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural form -- the step pyramid .
the old kingdom is perhaps best known for the large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for egypt 's kings .
for this reason , the old kingdom is frequently referred to as `` the age of the pyramids . ''
third dynasty
the first pharaoh of the old kingdom was djoser ( sometime between 2691 and 2625 bc ) of the third dynasty , who ordered the construction of a pyramid ( the step pyramid ) in memphis ' necropolis , saqqara .
an important person during the reign of djoser was his vizier , imhotep .
it was in this era that formerly independent ancient egyptian states became known as nomes , under the rule of the pharaoh .
the former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection .
egyptians in this era worshipped their pharaoh as a god , believing that he ensured the annual flooding of the nile that was necessary for their crops .
egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles , and the pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles .
they also perceived themselves as a specially selected people .
fourth dynasty
the old kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the fourth dynasty ( 2613 -- 2494 bc ) , which began with sneferu ( 2613 -- 2589 bc ) .
after djoser , pharaoh snefru was the next great pyramid builder .
snefru commissioned the building of not one , but three pyramids .
the first is called the meidum pyramid , named for its location in egypt .
snefru abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid .
the meidum pyramid was the first to have an above-ground burial chamber .
using more stones than any other pharaoh , he built the three pyramids : a now collapsed pyramid in meidum , the bent pyramid at dahshur , and the red pyramid , at north dahshur .
however , the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at saqqara , but during the building of ` the great pyramids ' at giza .
sneferu was succeeded by his son , khufu ( 2589 -- 2566 bc ) , who built the great pyramid of giza .
after khufu 's death , his sons djedefra ( 2566 -- 2558 bc ) and khafra ( 2558 -- 2532 bc ) may have quarrelled .
the latter built the second pyramid and ( in traditional thinking ) the sphinx in giza .
recent reexamination of evidence has led egyptologist vassil dobrev to propose that the sphinx had been built by djedefra as a monument to his father khufu .
alternatively , the sphinx has been proposed to be the work of khafra and khufu himself .
there were military expeditions into canaan and nubia , with egyptian influence reaching up the nile into what is today the sudan .
the later kings of the fourth dynasty were king menkaure ( 2532 -- 2504 bc ) , who built the smallest pyramid in giza , shepseskaf ( 2504 -- 2498 bc ) and , perhaps , djedefptah ( 2498 -- 2496 bc ) .
fifth dynasty
the fifth dynasty ( 2494 -- 2345 bc ) began with userkaf ( 2494 -- 2487 bc ) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god ra .
consequently , fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the 4th dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in abusir .
userkaf was succeeded by his son sahure ( 2487 -- 2475 bc ) who commanded an expedition to punt .
sahure was in turn succeeded by neferirkare kakai ( 2475 -- 2455 bc ) who was sahure 's son .
neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary .
he was followed by two short-lived kings , his son neferefre ( 2455 -- 2453 bc ) and shepseskare , the latter of uncertain parentage .
shepseskare may have been deposed by neferefre 's brother nyuserre ini ( 2445 -- 2421 bc ) , a long lived pharaoh who built extensively in abusir and re-started royal activity in giza .
the last pharaohs of the dynasty were menkauhor kaiu ( 2421 -- 2414 bc ) , djedkare isesi ( 2414 -- 2375 bc ) and unas ( 2375 -- 2345 ) , the earliest ruler to have the pyramid texts inscribed in his pyramid .
egypt 's expanding interests in trade goods such as ebony , incense such as myrrh and frankincense , gold , copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea .
they traded with lebanon for cedar and traveled the length of the red sea to the kingdom of punt -- possibly modern day somalia -- for ebony , ivory and aromatic resins .
ship builders of that era did not use pegs ( treenails ) or metal fasteners , but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled .
planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together .
sixth dynasty
during the sixth dynasty ( 2345 -- 2181 bc ) the power of pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs ( regional governors ) .
these no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary , thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the pharaoh .
however , nile flood control was still the subject of very large works , including especially the canal to lake moeris around 2300 bc , which was likely also the source of water to the giza pyramid complex centuries earlier .
internal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of pepi ii ( 2278 -- 2184 bc ) towards the end of the dynasty .
his death , certainly well past that of his intended heirs , might have created succession struggles .
the country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of pepi ii 's reign .
the final blow was the 22nd century bc drought in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation .
for at least some years between 2200 and 2150 bc , this prevented the normal flooding of the nile .
whatever its cause , the collapse of the old kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife .
an important inscription on the tomb of ankhtifi , a nomarch during the early first intermediate period , describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land .
culture
egypt 's old kingdom ( dynasties 3 -- 6 , ca .
2649 -- 2150 bc ) was one of the most dynamic periods in the development of egyptian art .
during this period , artists learned to express their culture 's worldview , creating for the first time images and forms that endured for generations .
architects and masons mastered the techniques necessary to build monumental structures in stone .
sculptors created the earliest portraits of individuals and the first lifesize statues in wood , copper , and stone .
they perfected the art of carving intricate relief decoration and , through keen observation of the natural world , produced detailed images of animals , plants , and even landscapes , recording the essential elements of their world for eternity in scenes painted and carved on the walls of temples and tombs .
these images and structures had two principal functions : to ensure an ordered existence and to defeat death by preserving life into the next world .
to these ends , over a period of time , egyptian artists adopted a limited repertoire of standard types and established a formal artistic canon that would define egyptian art for more than 3,000 years , while remaining flexible enough to allow for subtle variation and innovation .
although much of their artistic effort was centered on preserving life after death , egyptians also surrounded themselves with objects to enhance their lives in this world , producing elegant jewelry , finely carved and inlaid furniture , and cosmetic vessels and implements made from a wide range of materials .
